Quantum algorithms are meant to leverage the promising power of quantum computers \cite{coles18:quant_algor_implem_begin}.
Commonly described as quantum circuits, quantum algorithms are hardware agnostic \cite{Nielsen_2009}.
Due to the variety of technologies that emerged to build quantum memories, the algorithms tend to be as theoretical as possible.
From ion traps [? paper on ion traps] to superconducting qubit \cite{Barends_2014}, through quantum dots \cite{Hill_2015,Li_2018}, each layout has its own requirements and constraints.
Also, the qubit chip layouts from IBM \cite{IBM_QX}, Google \cite{boixo16:charac_quant_suprem_near_term_devic} and Rigetti \cite{Sete_2016} are quite limited.

Moreover, quantum devices -- no matter which technology -- are error prone.
Quantum operations are faulty and qubits are not able to hold the desired state for long times, gradually rotating to another state -- the qubit decoheres.
\uline{[some numbers for the technologies]} \cite{O_Brien_2017}.
This creates an undesirable environment to compute the most useful algorithms.
Therefore, in order to fight the errors generated by this behaviour, fault-tolerant (FT) and quantum error correction (QEC) mechanisms have been developed during the last years \cite{Nielsen_2009} [? papers on error correction].
These techniques force the quantum chips layout to arrange the qubits in a particular manner \cite{Versluis_2017}, constraining them even more.

A link between the algorithms and the devices is required \cite{Fu_2016} thus.
As in classical computation, the algorithms should go through a compilation process in order to adapt them to the hosting device.
Certainly, the mapping procedure is an important part of this process based on three sub-tasks, scheduling, initial placement and routing; as we considered before.

There is a considerable amount of literature on the mapping task.
Initial works on this field \cite{Metodi_2006,Whitney_2007,Bahreini_2015} focused primarily on the definition of what they defined as a \emph{scheduler} able to parallelize operations and add the require ones to route qubits.
They would consider general constraints, common for most of the hardware devices -- although the works were examining ion-traps as hardware implementations.
The proposed techniques examine a dependency graph looking for the best way to organize qubits and operations.
The majority of the methods use latency as the metric to minimize, however some of them \cite{Farghadan_2017} would minimize in \#SWAPS.
Following a similar reasoning as the first approaches, more complex solutions \cite{booth18:compar_integ_const_progr_tempor} have been published.
And, also, several works \cite{Lye_2015,Wille_2016} outlining only the routing sub-task.
