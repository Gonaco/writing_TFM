Quantum algorithms are meant to leverage the promising power of quantum computers \cite{coles18:quant_algor_implem_begin}.
Commonly described as quantum circuits, quantum algorithms are hardware agnostic, which is that their behavior is not specified no any device.
Due to the variety of technologies that emerged with diverse specifications, there is a vast amount of literature on the algorithms high abstraction level -- forgetting hardware constraints.
From ion traps [? paper on ion traps] to superconducting qubits \cite{Barends_2014,Versluis_2017}, through quantum dots \cite{Hill_2015,Li_2018}, each layout has its own requirements and constraints.
Although all of them are arranged in a 2D -- planar -- structure, ion traps technologies are capable to connect the qubits in all-to-all networks while superconducting technologies connections form a grid shaped network where each qubit is connected to a maximum of four neighbors.
This grid behaviour establishes one of the main limitation in today's quantum chips, the NN constraint.
Also, another superconducting-based qubit chip layouts from IBM \cite{IBM_QX}, Google \cite{boixo16:charac_quant_suprem_near_term_devic} and Rigetti \cite{Sete_2016} follow this structural limitations.


Thus, a link between the algorithms and the devices is required \cite{Fu_2016}.
As in classical computation, the algorithms should go through a compilation process in order to adapt them to the hosting device.
Certainly, the mapping procedure is an important part of this process based on three sub-tasks: scheduling, initial placement and routing; as we considered before.

There is a considerable amount of literature on the mapping task.
Initial works on this field \cite{Metodi_2006,Whitney_2007,Bahreini_2015} focused primarily on the definition of what they characterized a \emph{scheduler} able to parallelize operations and add the require ones to route qubits.
They would consider general constraints, common for most of the hardware devices -- although the works were examining ion-traps as hardware implementations.
The proposed techniques examine a dependency graph looking for the best way to organize qubits and operations.
The majority of the methods use latency as the metric to minimize, however some of them \cite{Farghadan_2017} would minimize in number of SWAP operations.
Following a similar reasoning as the first approaches, more complex solutions \cite{booth18:compar_integ_const_progr_tempor} have been published.
Also, several publications \cite{Lye_2015,Wille_2016} outlining only the routing sub-task using the number of SWAPS as the metric to minimize.
A recent review of the literature on the mapping topic \cite{zulehner17:effic_method_mappin_quant_circuit,Siraichi_2018,mckay18:qiskit_backen_specif_openq_openp_exper,Dueck_2018,Venturelli_2018} focused on device specific mapping algorithms, with promising results.

In addition to the previous limitations, quantum devices -- no matter which technology -- are error prone.
Quantum operations are faulty and qubits are not able to hold the desired state for long times, gradually rotating to another state -- the qubit decoheres.
\uline{[some numbers for the technologies]} \cite{O_Brien_2017}.
This creates an undesirable environment to compute the most useful algorithms.
Therefore, in order to fight the errors generated by this behaviour, fault-tolerant (FT) and quantum error correction (QEC) mechanisms have been developed during the last years \cite{Nielsen_2009} [? papers on error correction].
These techniques force the quantum chips layout to arrange the qubits in a particular manner, constraining them even more.

Many attempts have been made \cite{Dousti_2014,Heckey_2015,hwang18:hierar_system_mappin_large_scale,murphy18:contr,Lao_2018} with the purpose of develop a FT mapping able to work at the logical -- qubit -- level.
However, due to the high complexity of the QEC techniques, quantum chips with large amounts of qubits are still theory.
More recent evidence \cite{Preskill_2018}, proposes the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices as the next step for near future hardware with an amount of 50-100 qubits and without QEC or much simpler encodings.
Several studies, for instance \cite{tannu18:case_variab_aware_polic_nisq,paler18:nisq,paler18:influen_initial_qubit_placem_durin}, have been conducted on the mapping algorithms required for NISQ devices.
