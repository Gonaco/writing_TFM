    # All the work will be centered in the _SC-7_ and _SC-17_ chips constraints (always at the _physical_ level, thus without error correction), but everything will be simulated with two different error models. Pauli Noise (_QX_) and (_quantumsim_).

    The work is centered in:

    - SC-7 and SC-17 chips
    - Physical level, without error correction
    - Two error models:
      - Pauli Noise (QX simulator)
      - Complex empirical error model (quantumsim)
