** Mapping Metrics

As mentioned in the [[id:e9551941-a680-421a-aecc-8b103368acd6][Mapping metrics]] section in the second chapter, we name mapping metrics to those metrics used to assert the quality of a mapper.
In this section we will review the common metrics as the *number of SWAPs* or the *latency*, but we will also define -- and study in more detail -- some new mapping metrics that we incorporated, *probability of success* and *Quantum Volume*.
