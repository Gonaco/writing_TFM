*** Intro                                                          :ignore:

After the selection of benchmarks in the [[id:b34a4c5d-044f-4604-a95a-5028ee7f98ff]] section, we started their simulations with the simulation framework.
Not surprisingly, some of the benchmarks had very long simulations times or were even impossible to simulate in our lab servers.
Most of them with more than ten qubits.
As we mentioned before throughout this thesis, the simulation of quantum systems is computationally exhausting.
As the number of qubits or the longitude of the circuit increases, the harder would be to simulate them.
And even more in our case, that we need to run multiple simulations in a complex error model.
Therefore, as it can be seen in \ref{tab:map_selected_benchs}, we aware the low number of qubits limitation in the analysis.

We can inherit that the longer the circuit is before being mapped, the less impact the mapping will have over it.
In this case, even before mapped, the circuit is going to have a low fidelity or probability of success.
And after mapped, that situation does not change that much.

- In order to get this figure we filter fidelity. Only f>0.5 is plot
- Infidelity: $\frac{f_a - f_b}{1 - f_b}$
- Depth is the depth before mapping
- We decided to see it like this in order to cluster the same benchmark mapped in different ways
- We can conclude that the mapper quality is critical for benchmarks with small depth before being mapped, but for long circuits the mapper quality gets diminished. This means that simple and, therefore, faster mappers can be implemented for long circuits making possible the mapping on the fly, for instance
