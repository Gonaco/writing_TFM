We define probability of success as the probability of having the correct or expected results after running and measuring several times a quantum algorithm.
For instance, if the expected result of an algorithm is ~0100~ and the results are either ~0001~ or ~1111~ we will get a failure.
We will only get a success if the algorithm returns ~0100~.
Then, in the previous example, if we get ~0001~, ~0100~ and ~1111~ as results after running the algorithm three times the resulting probability of success will be $\frac{1}{3}$.
This model was chosen because it is one of the most practical ways to include the measurement gate into the error analysis.
But, at the same time, we aware that this metric have a limitation: it cannot assert -- in just one run -- the success of an algorithm that ideally returns a quantum state different that either the ground or the excited state.
Once a quantum state is measured it collides in either ground or excited.
In order to extract the complete quantum state, several runs of the circuit should be done, inheriting the results as a probabilistic distribution or histogram.
For a state as $0.3 | 0 \rangle + 0.7 | 1 \rangle$, after several measurements, we will get ~0~ a 30% of the times and ~1~ 70% of the times.
Accordingly, in order to calculate the probability of success, we will need to compare histograms instead of only one measured result.

# Fidelity definition

Although not taking into account the measurement, the quantum fidelity metric is related with the probability of success.
Both compare two quantum states, but, while the success of an algorithm is a boolean metric -- either success or failure --, the fidelity returns a number of how different the states are.
How far is one state from the other.
As an analogy, if we consider the quantum states as vectors, the fidelity would be the dot product between them.
However, the fidelity between orthogonal states -- states that differ in rotations around the x-axis as $| 0100 \rangle$, $| 0001 \rangle$ and $| 1111 \rangle$ -- is also 0.
In eq. [[eq:general_fidelity]] the fidelity formula is shown to understand its behaviour.

#+NAME: eq:general_fidelity
\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle F(\rho ,\sigma )=\left(\operatorname {Tr} {\sqrt {{\sqrt {\rho }}\sigma {\sqrt {\rho }}}}\right)^{2},}
\end{equation}

where $\rho =\sum _{i}p_{i}|i\rangle \langle i|$ and $\sigma =\sum _{i}q_{i}|i\rangle \langle i|$.
These states are named *mixed states* and they are defined as the weighted sum of different pure states.
This is the general case in order to calculate the fidelity in any case.
But, for a situation with one of the states as pure state (${\displaystyle \rho =|\psi _{\rho }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\rho }|}$) the calculation of fidelity reduces its complexity as it can be understood from eq. [[eq:fidelity_simple]].
Eq. [[eq:fidelity_super_simple]] the next step of simplicity, the one in which both states are pure (${\displaystyle \rho =|\psi _{\rho }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\rho }|}, {\displaystyle \sigma =|\psi _{\sigma }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\sigma }|} {\displaystyle \sigma =|\psi _{\sigma }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\sigma }|}$).

# Fidelity vs. Probability of success (With the probability of success we take into account the measurement probability of error and it is much easier to calculate) (It could happen to have a bad fidelity but a correct probability of success)

In our study, we will use both metrics in order to calculate the amount of errors that arise from an algorithm.
As soon as fidelity is not taking into account the measurement errors, it is common that both metrics differ completely.
It could be the case that a quantum state is erroneous before the measurement and, then, due to the error added from the measurement the erroneous state would flip and converge into the expected state.
At the same time, a correct quantum state could be measured wrongly due to the measurement errors.
