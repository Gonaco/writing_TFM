# Introduction

# Fidelity definition



#+NAME: eq:general_fidelity
\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle F(\rho ,\sigma )=\left(\operatorname {Tr} {\sqrt {{\sqrt {\rho }}\sigma {\sqrt {\rho }}}}\right)^{2},}
\end{equation}

where $\rho =\sum _{i}p_{i}|i\rangle \langle i|$ and $\sigma =\sum _{i}q_{i}|i\rangle \langle i|$.
These states are named *mixed states* and they are defined as the weighted sum of different pure states.
This is the general case in order to calculate the fidelity in any case.
But, for a situation with one of the states as pure state (${\displaystyle \rho =|\psi _{\rho }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\rho }|}$) the calculation of fidelity reduces its complexity as it can be understood from eq. [[eq:fidelity_simple]].
Eq. [[eq:fidelity_super_simple]] the next step of simplicity, the one in which both states are pure (${\displaystyle \rho =|\psi _{\rho }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\rho }|}, {\displaystyle \sigma =|\psi _{\sigma }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\sigma }|} {\displaystyle \sigma =|\psi _{\sigma }\rangle \!\langle \psi _{\sigma }|}$).


# Fidelity simplistic cases

#+NAME: eq:fidelity_simple
\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle F(\rho ,\sigma )=\operatorname {Tr} \left[{\sqrt {|\psi _{\rho }\rangle \langle \psi _{\rho }|\sigma |\psi _{\rho }\rangle \langle \psi _{\rho }|}}\right]^{2}=\langle \psi _{\rho }|\sigma |\psi _{\rho }\rangle \operatorname {Tr} \left[{\sqrt {|\psi _{\rho }\rangle \langle \psi _{\rho }|}}\right]^{2}=\langle \psi _{\rho }|\sigma |\psi _{\rho }\rangle .}
\end{equation}

#+NAME: eq:fidelity_super_simple
\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle F(\rho ,\sigma )=|\langle \psi _{\rho }|\psi _{\sigma }\rangle |^{2}}
\end{equation}




# Fidelity vs. Probability of success (With the probability of success we take into account the measurement probability of error and it is much easier to calculate) (It could happen to have a bad fidelity but a correct probability of success)
