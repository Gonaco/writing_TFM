# Introduction

# Fidelity definition



#+NAME: eq:general_fidelity
\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle F(\rho ,\sigma )=\left(\operatorname {Tr} {\sqrt {{\sqrt {\rho }}\sigma {\sqrt {\rho }}}}\right)^{2},}
\end{equation}

where $\rho =\sum _{i}p_{i}|i\rangle \langle i|$ and $\sigma =\sum _{i}q_{i}|i\rangle \langle i|$.
These states are named mixed states and they are defined as the weighted sum of different pure states.
This is the general case in order to calculate the fidelity in any case.
But, for a situation of having one of the states as pure state (eq. [[eq:fidelity_simple]]) or, even, having both (eq. [[eq:fidelity_super_simple]]); the fidelity calculation is much more simplistic.

# Fidelity vs. Probability of success (With the probability of success we take into account the measurement probability of error and it is much easier to calculate) (It could happen to have a bad fidelity but a correct probability of success)
