# Intro (what is quantumsim, advantages)

Quantumsim cite:O_Brien_2017 is a simulator for superconducting systems and designed to study the SC-17 chip.
Its error model has been induced from the chip's behaviour after several experiments.
Therefore, quantumsim's error model is much more complete for the superconducting case than other general simulators.
Although, at the same time, the detail in its error model makes each simulation computationally harder.
As a matter of fact, quantumsim is able to boost its calculations with a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
Quantumsim can be found as *python library* in its [[https://github.com/quantumsim/quantumsim][github repository]] with instructions to install it and an overview of how to use it.
