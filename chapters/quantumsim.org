# Intro (what is quantumsim, advantages)

Quantumsim cite:O_Brien_2017 is a simulator of superconducting systems designed to study the SC-7 and SC-17 chips and based on their behaviour on experiments.
It performs calculations on *density matrices* instead of the compact representation of the quantum states because they permit the use of mixed states -- able to represent any kind of errors.
As it can be inherited in the [[id:68e8f11a-edd9-4e09-a99e-5ef841f010f7][Qubits]] subsection, the density matrix size grows exponentially with the number of qubits it represents -- $2^n \times 2^n$ where $n$ is the number of qubits.
Once the qubits state is ready as a density matrix, quantumsim applies the quantum gates in the *Pauli transfer matrix representation*.
The Pauli representation builds positive matrices that preserves the trace properties of the original matrix -- Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) transformation -- cite:Merkel_2013 to represent the gates.
In order to avoid non-efficient calculations, in place of building a huge density matrix considering all the qubits from the very beginning, quantumsim will enlarge dynamically the density matrix whenever a gate requires a new qubit.
As this calculations are computationally hard, quantumsim has the possibility of boosting calculations with a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).


# In the quantumsim module, all gates are applied in the Pauli transfer matrix representation:

#+NAME: eq:pauli_representation
\begin{equation}
(R_{\Lambda})_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} Tr(\sigma_i \Lambda \sigma_j)
\end{equation}

where $\Lambda$ is the CPTP transformation and $\sigma_i$ are the Pauli operators, viz. $\sigma_0 = I$, $\sigma_1 = X$, $\sigma_2 = Y$, $\sigma_3 = Z$, equivalent to rotations around the main axes of the Bloch sphere.

# One-qubit and two- qubit gates are applied to the density matrix as completely positive, trace preserving maps represented by Pauli transfer matrices. When a gate involving a << new >> qubit must be performed, the density matrix of the system is dynamically enlarged to include that one [...]




**** Error model

Quantumsim considers six main error sources in the SC-7 and SC-17, of which three comes from the different operations -- single/two-qubit gates and measurement -- and the others are either decoherence or apparatus related errors -- photon decay and the flux noise.
Each operation has its own model, based on the learning extracted from several experiments.
The same happens to the other studied phenomena that are incorporated in different ways in the gate matrices.
In this section we will describe the error sources and how they are simulated in quantumsim.
From decoherence to the apparatus related errors -- that affect the gates error.
Also, Tab. [[tab:err_pam]] pinpoints exactly the value of the parameters used in the error model.


***** Qubit Idling

While idling for a time $t$, a transmon in $|1\rangle$ or in superposition could relax to $|0\rangle$ or acquire random quantum phase shifts due to $1/f$ noise sources (flux noise) or others.
The dephasing effect only appears in a superposition state.

with $p_1 = 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{T_1}}$ and $p_{\phi} = 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{T_{\phi}}}$ that are the probabilities for relaxation and pure dephasing, respectively.

****** Qubit idling                                             :ignore:

Idling for a duration $t$:

#+NAME: eq:idling
\begin{equation}

R_{AP (t)} = R_{\Lambda_{T_1}} R_{\Lambda_{T_{\phi}}}

\end{equation}

***** Photon decay
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       07599b1a-0150-4e80-ad59-8ce826f8d96a
:END:

While measuring a qubit state under the presence of photons in a readout resonator, the coupled qubit is affected suffering a $p_{\phi, photon}$ dephasing.
This dephasing is present whenever the coupled qubit is brought into superposition before the readout resonator has returned to the vacuum state following the last measurement.
This dephasing is then implemented via the same Pauli transfer matrix as $R_{\Lambda_{T_{\phi}}}$ in eq. [[eq:idling]].

***** Flux Noise

Whenever a two-qubit operation is done, qubits are moved in frequency away to their sweetspot ($f_{q,max}$) with flux pulses as it was seen in the [[id:5fc58a48-9874-45ed-94ff-095153aeea0f][Constraints of the Surface-7 and -17 chips]] section.
And the only affected qubits are not the targeted ones, but also the NN that need to avoid the effects of the operation.
While outside their sweetspot, the qubits are highly affected by the noise inserted by the flux pulses.
This noise causes a random phase shift in the qubit state.
As soon as the power spectrum of the flux noise is $1/f$ -- main contribution is related with low-frequencies --, adjusting the qubit frequency to a lower frequency makes the qubit even more sensitive to it.

***** Single-qubit $R_y(\pi /2)$ rotations

Quantumsim models single-qubit gates adding idle matrices of duration $\frac{\tau_{g,1Q}}{2}$ before and after the CPTP gate representation, allowing the insertion of amplitude and phase damping ($T_1$ and $T_{\phi}$)).
The addition of this error is equivalent to shrinking a quantum state towards the origin.
Quantumsim considers this shrinking with a factor of $1 - p_{axis}$ along the y-axis and $1 - p_{plane}$ along the x- and z-axes as it is described in eq. [[eq:single_q_error]].

#+NAME: eq:single_q_error
\begin{equation}

R_{R_y (\pi /2)} = R_{AP (\frac{\tau_{g,1Q}}{2})} R_{R_y (\pi /2)}' R_{dep} R_{AP (\frac{\tau_{g,1Q}}{2})}

\end{equation}

where

$$R_{dep} = \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 - p_{plane} & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 - p_{axis} & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 - p_{plane} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

# #+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment bmatrix
# | 1 |             0 |            0 |             0 |
# | 0 | 1 - p_{plane} |            0 |             0 |
# | 0 |             0 | 1 - p_{axis} |             0 |
# | 0 |             0 |            0 | 1 - p_{plane} |

and $R_{R_y (\pi/2)}'$ is the Pauli transfer matrix describing the theoretical $\pi /2$ rotation along the y axis.
# This procedure could be done with whatever Pauli transfer matrix.
# The y rotation is just the most common example.

***** CZ gates

"The C-Z gate is achieved by flux pulsing a transmon into the $|11\rangle \leftrightarrow |02\rangle$ avoided crossing with another, where the 2 denotes the second-excited state of the fluxed transmon.
Holding the transmons here for $\tau_{g,2Q}$ causes the probability amplitudes of $|01\rangle$ and $|11\rangle$ to acquire phases[...]

Our full (but simplistic) model of the CZ gate consists of an instantaneous CZ gate with single-qubit phase error $\delta_{\phi_{1Q}}$ and two-qubit phase error $\delta_{\phi_{2Q}} = \frac{\delta_{\phi_{1Q}}}{2}$, sandwiched by idling intervals of duration $\frac{\tau_{g,2Q}}{2}$."


***** Measurement

# Qubit measurements are simulated as projective and following the Born rule, with projection probabilities given by the squared overlap of the input state with the measurement basis states. In order to capture empirical measurement errors, we implement a black-box measurement model by sandwiching the measurement between idling processes. After measuring some qubit they remove that qubit from the density matrix.

#+caption: The model for measurements consists of a dephasing of the qubit followed by a period of decay and excitation with probability $p_{\uparrow / \downarrow}^{(1)}$. At this point, the qubit state is sampled. The sampling result is subject to a declaration error $\epsilon_{RO}$, and the qubit state is subject to further decay or excitation with probabilities $p_{\uparrow / \downarrow}^{(2)}$ before the end of the measurement block
#+NAME: fig:meas_model
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.5\textwidth
[[file:figures/measure_model.png]]

The initial dephasing step in the measurement model (Fig. [[fig:meas_model]]) occurs due to the [[id:07599b1a-0150-4e80-ad59-8ce826f8d96a][photon decay]] effect.

"We find that the readout errors $\epsilon_{RO}^{|i\rangle}$ are almost independent of the qubit state $|i\rangle$, and so we describe them with a single readout error parameter $\epsilon_{RO}$".
The outcome-independent declaration error of $\epsilon_{RO} = \epsilon_{RO}^{1} = \epsilon_{RO}^{0} = 0.15 \%$ is extracted from experiments. 

They ignore effects leading to measurement-induced mixing and non-linearity of the readout resonator, as well as residual photon numbers.

**** Effects not taking into account

They use a simple model for the CZ errors.
They neglect leakage (previous experiments have reduced leakage probability per CZ to $\approx$ 0.3%) .
Of course this simplification is also in *quantumsim*.

***** Decoder Upper Bound explanation                          :noexport:

"We obtain the probability of a final measurement falling within each coset by summing the probabilities from the diagonal of the reduced density matrix of the data qubits in the Z-basis.
It contains the probability distribution for the 2^9 = 512 different possible measurement outcomes of the data qubits [...]

Any decoder can give the correct result only for half of the measurement outcomes.
No decoder can achieve a dec- laration fidelity larger than this maximal probability [...]

Declarations must be equal if they differ by the application of one ore more X stabilizers (applying two different logical X operators amounts to the application of a product of X stabilizers).
We thus group the outcomes in 32 cosets -- there are 4 X-stabilizers in SC-17, so there are 512/24 = 32 cosets --.
For outcomes from the same coset, the declaration from a decoder must be the same.
We further group the 32 cosets to 16 pairs, which differ by the application of a logical operator. 
The upper bound is then obtained by selecting the more probable coset from each pair and summing the corresponding probabilities [...]

We finally emphasize that the this upper bound can be found only because we have access to the complete probability distribution of outcomes.
We do not expect that any decoder can actually achieve this upper bound".




***** Optimization of logical error rates

As they explain in the paper and one can see in Fig. [[fig:meas_t_optim]], they find that the optimal measuring time for the minimum $\epsilon_L$ is 280 ns.

***** Projected improvement with advances in quantum hardware

- Memory figure of merit ($\gamma_m = \frac{\epsilon_{phys}}{\epsilon_{L}}$). How close are $\epsilon_{phys}$ and $\epsilon_{L}$. Metric to check how good the error correction is.

- Computational performance ($\gamma_c = \frac{\epsilon_{phys} \tau_{g,1Q}}{\epsilon_L \tau_{cycle}}$), where, at $\gamma_c = 1$ the computational break-even point is defined.

- A value of $T_1 > 80 \mu s$ for planar transmons is emerging.

***** Other observations

The following statements are fairly general:

- "Small quasi-static qubit errors are suppressed by the repeated measurements"
- If either the ancilla error rate ($\epsilon_{anc}$) or the \epsilon_{RO} are bigger than $\epsilon_{phys}$, $\epsilon_L$ becomes independent of both $\epsilon_{RO}$ and $\epsilon_{anc}$
- "Optimal cycle parameters for logical error rates per cycle and per unit time are not the same. This implies that logical qubits functioning as quantum memory should be treated differently to those being used for computation"
