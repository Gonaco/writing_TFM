The discoveries in quantum physics during the last century opened multiple questions and demonstrate strange behaviours that are far from the classical physics we are used to.
The answers of these questions as well as another field's investigations rely on the simulation of Nature.
In order to understand our world we need to simulate instances of it, but the simulation of Nature itself requires a huge computational power that is intractable for classical computers.
At the same time, we are witnesses of the Moore's law halt; we are reaching the limit in transistor sizes.
While trying to make them smaller, quantum phenomena appear making impossible a transistor behaviour.
During the last century Feynman had the idea of getting advantage of the unexplained but controllable quantum phenomena.
He noticed that this quantum phenomena that would stop the development of smaller transistors and, therefore, powerful chips, actually could be used to get much more computational power.

*** How quantum?                                                   :ignore:

To be able to control this quantum phenomena, quantum chips were developed.
And in order to be able to exploit its potential, quantum algorithms were developed.
But, to run the quantum algorithms in quantum chips the quantum algorithms should be adapted.
Our QCA lab at TU Delft University of Technology develop a general architecture for quantum computers cite:Fu_2016 that follow a process which steps can be see in Fig. ref:fig:system_stack.
This process goes from the algorithms description -- upper layer in the figure -- to the set of instructions that are sent as hardware dependent signals  -- lower layer -- to the hardware interface that controls the quantum chip.
