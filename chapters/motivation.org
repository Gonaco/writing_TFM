The discoveries in quantum physics during the last century opened multiple questions and demonstrate strange behaviours that are far from the classical physics we are used to.
The answer of these questions as well as another investigations from another fields require a huge computational power.
In order to understand our world we need to simulate instances of it, and for that we need computer systems with a calculation power further than anything in the world.
During the last century Feynman had the idea of getting advantage of the unexplained but controllable quantum phenomenon [ *REFER* ].
He noticed that the main strange behavior .
