# In this section ...

Quantum computers will be able to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.
For example, Shor's quantum algorithm is an integer factorization algorithm able to calculate prime numbers in polynomial time -- what is a main issue in computer security.
In the next sections we will explain the basics of quantum computation.

*** Essential elements of quantum computation

Quantum bit (or qubits) and quantum gates are the basic ingredients in quantum computation.
As in classical computation with boolean gates and bits, quantum gates operate on the qubits to change their state and return the desired result or calculation.

**** Qubits

A qubit is the basic unit of information.
A classical bit state can be either ~0~ or ~1~.
A qubit's state could be either ~0~ or ~1~ or both at the same time, what is called *superposition*.
Both, ground or excited states, are represented in the Dirac's bra-ket notation cite:Nielsen_2009, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ respectively.
A qubit is described as in a probabilistic state $| \psi \rangle = \alpha_0 | 0 \rangle + \alpha_1 | 1 \rangle$, where $\alpha_0, \alpha_1 \in \mathbb{C}$ are the so-called probability amplitudes.
$|\alpha_0|^2$ is the probability of measuring $| 0 \rangle$ and $|\alpha_1|^2$ is the probability of measuring $| 1 \rangle$.
In other words, when a qubit is measured, the measurement results '0' with probability $|\alpha_0|^2$ and '1' with probability $|\alpha_1|^2$.
And the qubit's state collapses to either $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$, respectively.
As $|\alpha_0|^2$ and $|\alpha_1|^2$  are probabilities, the sum of them should be $|\alpha_0|^2 + |\alpha_1|^2 = 1$.
Therefore a qubit state can be represented as a vector (eq. \ref{eq:org1bd4103}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:org1bd4103}
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_0 \\ \alpha_1 \end{bmatrix}

# To visualize the quantum states -> the Bloch sphere
As soon as the vectors are 2-dimensional, complex and unitary they can also be described in phase notation cite:Nielsen_2009.
Like the complex numbers, although requiring two angles in this case.
This notation lead us to an understandable way to visualize the quantum states, the *Bloch sphere* (fig. \ref{fig:bloch_sphere}).
A sphere of radius one which z-axis extremes represent the ground and excited states.

A system with just one qubit is not useful.
The power of quantum computers explodes with the number of qubits able to work with.
The quantum state of $n$ qubits can be represented in bra-ket notation, with a $2^n$ size.
The *entanglement* of qubits ($\phi$ and $\psi$) is the other main phenomenon in quantum physics that describes the fact that several qubits behave like the same one cite:Nielsen_2009.


**** Quantum Operations

Quantum operations leverage the power of quantum computers enabling calculations on the qubits.
Quantum operations change the state of qubit.
One can find a parallelism with the classical computation fundamental operations, the logical operations.
As their classical siblings, the quantum operations are usually represented as gates in a circuit, a so-called quantum circuit.
Quantum operations can be described in Dirac's notation as well.
They are represented as square matrices of $2^{n} \times 2^{n}$, where $n$ is the number of qubits involved in the operation.
This matrices should be unitary respecting the qubit state vector unitary property ($|\alpha_0|^2 + |\alpha_1|^2 = 1$).
Quantum operations can be represented as state rotations in the Bloch sphere (fig. \ref{fig:bloch_sphere}).
Although, while implying multiple qubits, the quantum operations are more complex than just rotations, as it will be seen below.
For instance, a rotation of 180° in x-axis of the Bloch sphere is the same as an operation that changes the qubit state from $| 0 \rangle$ to $| 1 \rangle$, or viceversa.

#+NAME: eq:inner_prod_ex
\begin{equation}
U |\psi\rangle=\begin{bmatrix}u_{00}&u_{01}\\u_{10}&u_{11}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_0 \\ \alpha_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_0 u_{00} + \alpha_1 u_{01} \\ \alpha_0 u_{10} + \alpha_1 u_{11} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

# Universal set of gates + ¿Intro to differentiation of single- and two-qubit gates?
*Universal set of gates* is a set of operations able to generate any other gate by combining them cite:Nielsen_2009.
In classical computation, for example, the ~OR~ and the ~AND~ gates are able to generate any other logic gate.
Also comparable with the boolean gates, quantum operations can be decomposed in other set of quantum operations.
In quantum computation there are several universal set of gates.
The most used one is the *Clifford+T* set, formed by the Clifford gate set -- phase shifts around the three axes, H and CNOT -- and the T gate.

***** Single-qubit gates

Single qubit gates represent quantum operations that involve just one qubit.
They are represented as a box with one input and one output, evincing that a single qubit will be the input and output of the operation.
As explained before, single-qubit gates can be represented as $2^1 \times 2^1$ square matrices that should be unitary.
Both representations of the most common single-qubit gates can be found in Table [[tab:single_q_gates]].

#+INCLUDE: single_gates_table.org::tab:single_q_gates

# Each gate explanation
The /Identity/ gate is the idling operation.
It is equivalent to no applying any operation for a cycle.
The /Pauli-x, -y and -z/ gates are 180° rotation over the x-, y- and z-axis respectively.
Eg. a qubit with state $|+\rangle$ that is equivalent to the position $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}, \phi = 0$ in the Bloch sphere is rotated in the y-axis with a Pauli-y gate, $Y|+\rangle = \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.
This resulting state is located in $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}, \phi = \pi$, that is a 180° rotation in the Y axis.
The /Hadamard/ gate is also a 180° rotation, but over the diagonal axis between the x- and z-axes, $\frac{({\hat {x}}+{\hat {z}})}{\sqrt {2}}}$.
The /S/ and /T/ gates are also rotations over the z-axis but of 90° and 45° respectively.


***** Two-qubit gates

Two-qubit gates are quantum operations that involve two qubits at the same time.
In general, the two-qubit gates execute a single-qubit operation over one of the qubits, depending on the state of the other.
The qubits that goes through the operation is called *target*, while the other is called the *control* qubit.
The most common two-qubit gates are represented in Table [[tab:two_q_gates]].
The /CNOT/ gate is a Controlled-NOT operation or, what is the same, a Pauli-x gate that, depending on the state of the control qubit will be executed or not.
If the control qubit is $| 1 \rangle$ the, the Pauli-x will be activated and the target qubit's state will be rotated.
As the CNOT, the /CZ/ gate is a Controlled-Z operation that, in this case, executes a Pauli-z gate depending on the state of the control qubit.
Finally, the /SWAP/ gate exchanges the state of two qubits.
This gate is mostly used for routing purposes as it will be seen in the next sections.

#+INCLUDE: two_q_gates_table.org::tab:two_q_gates

*** Quantum Circuits

Quantum circuits are quantum algorithms descriptions.
As mentioned before, they are formed by quantum gates and qubits connected in circuit fashion.
As most of the algorithm description models -- no matter if classical or quantum --, quantum circuits are hardware agnostic, which is that they are not specified to any quantum device.
In fig. \ref{fig:circuit_example} we present an example of a quantum circuit.
This circuit represents the quantum equivalent of a Gray encoder of six bit length.
It is composed by CNOT gates only.
An example of the Gray code is shown in \ref{fig:gray_code_example} for different number of bits ($n$).

*** Qubits are faulty
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       016d3e26-fc74-45a4-a459-1934d84c24bf
:END:

Quantum operations are faulty and qubits are not able to hold the desired state for long times, gradually rotating to another state -- the qubit decoheres.
For instance, in the case of superconducting technologies cite:O_Brien_2017, the chips bear with decoherence times of $\approx 30 \mu s$ for qubit relaxation and $\approx 60 \mu s$ for qubit dephase.
The error rates of single-qubit gates are less than 0.1% taking $> 20 ns$ to be executed, while two-qubit gates error rate is 0.6% with times of $40 ns$ and measurement error rates around 1% with execution times of $\sim 300 ns$ cite:O_Brien_2017,Versluis_2017.
This creates an undesirable environment to compute the most useful algorithms.
Therefore, in order to fight the errors generated by this behaviour, fault-tolerant (FT) and quantum error correction (QEC) mechanisms have been developed during the last years cite:Nielsen_2009.
