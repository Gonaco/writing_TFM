# What is a metric, why do we need them

# Intro to metrics from the state of the art [As outlined in the state of the art, the literature considers mainly two metrics to report the mapping quality of their algorithms.]

# Metrics criticism [Research has tended to focus on either depth or number of SWAPS rather than the error produced by the mapping.]

As outlined in the state of the art, the literature considers mainly two metrics to report the quality of their mapping algorithms, the added *latency* and the *number* of introduced *operations* after the mapping procedure.
Latency is the time required to run a quantum circuit in a given quantum device.
It depends on the chip cycle time and the depth of the circuit, that is the number of cycles in the algorithm.
On the other hand, the number of operations is ..

Both stand on correct -- but not precise -- reasoning.
The latency metric states that the longer the circuit, the more errors would appear.
Indeed, time is a main issue in quantum computing.
Decoherence time is not only a maximum qubit lifetime, the quantum state would be harder to hold for times closer to the decoherence time.
So, 

The more these metrics grow, the worst the mapping is.
Research has tended to focus on either latency or number of SWAPS rather than the error produced by the mapping.
