# Intro to metrics from the state of the art [As outlined in the state of the art, the literature considers mainly two metrics to report the mapping quality of their algorithms.]

As outlined in the state of the art, the literature considers mainly two metrics to optimize in their mapping algorithms, the added *latency* and the *number* of introduced *operations* after the mapping procedure.
The routing step from the mapping process introduces SWAP gates in the quantum circuit in order to move the qubits around in the layout.
And latency is the time required to run a quantum circuit in a given quantum device.
It depends on the chip cycle time and the *depth* of the circuit, that is the number of cycles the algorithm encloses.
Actually, most of the studies [REFERENCES] assert the latency in terms of circuit depth.
E.g. in Fig. \ref{latency_swaps_ex}, one can see how after the mapping process some SWAP operations have been added as well as the depth of the circuit or latency grows.
From five cycles depth in the original circuit to nine cycles.

# Metrics criticism [Research has tended to focus on either depth or number of SWAPS rather than the error produced by the mapping.]

The ideal mapping would be the one affecting the least as possible the original circuit or, what is the same, introducing the least amount of errors.
Clearly, both, latency and number of SWAPs, are direct effects of the mapping procedure that have an impact in the error increment.
To optimize in any of them stands on correct -- but not sufficient -- reasoning.
The latency optimization states that the leading error source comes from the qubit lifetime.
And, indeed, time is a main issue in quantum computing.
Decoherence time is not only a maximum qubit lifetime, it is harder and harder to hold a quantum state for use times closer to the decoherence time.
On the other hand, to optimize in number of SWAPs stands on the gate error as the preeminent error in a quantum computer.
As seen in the [PROBLEM STATEMENT SECTION], the higher the number of operations does not necessarily mean the longer circuit depth.
Several operations can be run in the same cycle -- at the same time.

, although these metrics are not enough to assert how good the process is.


The more these metrics grow, the worse the mapping is.
Research has tended to focus on either latency or number of SWAPS rather than the error produced by the mapping.

In our study we will analyze these metrics amongst other different ones as fidelity, probability of success or quantum volume and their impact in the error evolution.
