Latency is the time required to run a quantum circuit in a given quantum device.
The introduction of gates due to the mapping makes the target circuit longer.
Or what is the same, the introduction of SWAPs -- or their decomposition -- adds several cycles to the depth of the circuit.
Therefore, the latency of the circuit increases.
For instance, in the [[id:d1e90d41-ecaa-46b4-9f20-7a7726caa34a][Mapping example]], we can see how the latency grows after the circuit is routed to 1840 ns and then it is reduced to 1520 ns after re-scheduling.

One of the main source of errors is the decoherence, that is the quantum phenomena that makes the qubits loose their state along time.
The longer a quantum device is running an algorithm, the more errors would appear.
Or what is the same, the longer the circuit, the more erroneous will be the result.
The task of the scheduler -- one of the three mapping steps -- is to look for gates that can be run in parallel
Considering that time is one of the main error sources and that the scheduler task is to make operations simultaneously, one can understand why latency is used in order to assert the capacity of mapping algorithm
Nonetheless, as the number of SWAPs this metric is not giving enough information for that.

# Why is latency not good enough metric?
The latency of a circuit gives an intuition of how long it is but, unlike the number of operations, it gives no information about the number of operations it has.
And, therefore, it gives no intuition about how the gate errors are affecting the algorithm final result.
