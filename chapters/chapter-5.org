* Results

In this chapter the simulation results are presented with reference to the aim of the thesis, which was to study the mapping metrics:
their precision when assessing the mapping quality and their relation with the error amount after mapping.
First, in the [[id:96ce8da9-08d8-4fbb-9b15-8b044f01f1b7][Impact of the mapping on the algorithm reliability]] section we show how the mapping procedure affects the general increment of error.
After that, we analyze the metrics and their correlation with the error increase in the [[id:586ca325-54d8-4b90-93a0-1253140147c4][Analysis of the mapping metrics]] section.
# Finally, in the [[id:5520e10c-045c-445a-a863-7eb221ad05c4][Regression analysis]] section, after a regression study, we offer a way to predict the amount of errors a circuit could get depending on the its characteristics.
