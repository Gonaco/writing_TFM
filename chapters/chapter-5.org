* Results

In this section the simulation results are presented.
We first show how the mapping procedure affects the general increment of error.
After that, we analyze the metrics and their correlation with the error increase.
Finally, after a regression study, we offer a way to predict the amount of errors a circuit could get depending on the its characteristics.
