To read our E-mail, how mean
of the spies and their quantum machine;
be comforted though,
the do not yet know
how to factorize twelve or fifteen.

* Introduction to quantum computation

  # Temporal introduction. Quantum was big in the 90's but the biggest thing came in 2010

  # "Quantum computing exploits quantum-mechanical effect" ... "superposition entanglement an quantum tunneling" cite:coles18:quant_algor_implem_begin

  # Why Quantum computation?
  # - ...
  # - Supercomputation power
  # - Quantum chemistry simulation cite:Feynman_1982 cite:Wecker_2015
  # - ...

  # Future of Quantum Computers cite:preskill18:quant_comput_nisq

** ...

** ...

** Quantum Circuits

   # Representation

   # Hardware agnostic

   # Rules of the circuits (they are not like classical circuits representation)

* State of the Art and the mapping problem

** Quantum computers, the physical apparatus

   # Conditions for quantum computation

   # Different types: Quantum gate array (computation decomposed into sequence of few-qubit quantum gates), One-way quantum computer (computation decomposed into sequence of one-qubit measurements applied to a highly entangled initial state or cluster state), Adiabatic quantum computer, based on quantum annealing (computation decomposed into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution), Topological quantum computer (computation decomposed into the braiding of anyons in a 2D lattice)

   # Different realizations: harmonic oscillator, optical photon, optical cavity, ion traps, nuclear magnetic resonance, superconducting chips, quantum dots, ...

** Chips constraints

   # Introduction to superconducting chips and chips in general
   # "Recently, superconducting chips have reached a new level of maturity. They have become fully programmable multi-qubit machines that provide the user with a flexibility to implement arbitrary quantum circuits from a high-level interface. This makes it possible for the first time to test quantum computers irrespective of their particular physical implementation" cite:Linke_2017

   # Different types of chips: IBM QX, QuTech SC, Google, ...

   # Constraints of those examples

** Stack computer architecture

# Problems that quantum computers want to solve are small hard problems -> Quantum computer as an accelerator

# At some point in the long future the classical machines won't be enough to deal with quantum accelerators
